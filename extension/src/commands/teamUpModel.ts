/** Shell command: ensure the target tmux session (and thus a tmux server)
 *  exists, wake the team into it, then attach the user.
 *
 *  The `new-session -A -d` bootstrap is essential: `maw team up` lists panes as a
 *  precondition and HARD-FAILS with "no server running" on a cold VM (no live
 *  tmux) — which is exactly what happens after a reboot / snapshot. `-A` makes it
 *  idempotent (no-op if the session is already live, e.g. a warm server), `-d`
 *  keeps it detached. team up then adds each member as its own WINDOW of this
 *  session, named `<repo-stem>-<oracle>` (e.g. `missioncontrol-bob`).
 *
 *  Two cleanups keep the tmux status bar short and readable:
 *   - each member window is renamed to just the bare oracle (`${w#*-}` strips the
 *     `<repo-stem>-` prefix). SAFE for maw: classifyMember matches a window whose
 *     name equals a member candidate, and the bare oracle IS a candidate — so
 *     `maw team status/send/enter` still resolve these panes, and per-agent git
 *     worktree isolation is untouched (only the display name changes).
 *   - the `_boot` bootstrap window is KILLED once members exist (`; kill-window`),
 *     so it doesn't linger as a phantom member. The session survives on its
 *     member windows.
 *  On a failed up the rename/kill are skipped and attach still drops the user on
 *  the `_boot` shell with the error in scrollback.
 *
 *  `--force` + `--only` per member is what makes the button reliable:
 *   - `--force` stops team up RESUMING a member whose pane lingers from a prior
 *     run (it would send `claude … --continue` and, on the default engine, hit the
 *     unconfigured `default-resume`).
 *   - waking ONE member per invocation (`--only`) serializes the launches. Plain
 *     `maw team up` fans every member out through `Promise.all`, and those
 *     concurrent tmux `send-keys` race — keystrokes cross panes and concatenate
 *     (→ `--dangerously-skip-permissionsclaude` / `--continueclaude`, "unknown
 *     option", member never boots). Sequential `--only` waking is deterministic:
 *     each member's claude is up before the next is launched.
 *  Live members of an ALREADY-up team aren't clobbered — the caller mints a new
 *  `-N` session for those. `members` is the roster (bare oracle names); empty →
 *  fall back to a single plain up (charter decides who wakes).
 *  team/session/members are validated (isSafeTeamName / SAFE_SESSION) and cwd is a
 *  fixed local path before this. */
